# Vault Rules — Quick Reference
**Fast lookup for critical vault standards**

---

## 📋 Every Note Must Have

### 1. Complete YAML Frontmatter
```yaml
---
type: [note type]
area: [work/health/finances/household/interests/relationships/education/system]
status: [inbox/active/complete/archived/retired]
tags:
  - [at least one tag]
---
```

**All four fields required:** `type`, `area`, `status`, `tags`  
**No empty values** — especially `area:` must have a value

---

### 2. Navigation Header (First Line After Frontmatter)

**Daily notes (Journal/):**
```
> [[🏠base|🏠]] · [[YYYY-MM-DD|← Yesterday]] · [📅 Today](obsidian://daily) · [[YYYY-MM-DD|Tomorrow →]]
```

**System notes & Area Hubs:**
```
> [[🏠base|🏠]] · [📅 Today](obsidian://daily)
```

**Area-specific notes (most notes):**
```
> [[🏠base|🏠]] · [📅 Today](obsidian://daily) · [[Area Hub|Area Hub]]
```
Examples:
- Work notes: `[[Work Hub|Work Hub]]`
- Health notes: `[[Health Hub|Health Hub]]`
- Household notes: `[[Household Hub|Household Hub]]`

**Special context (workout logs):**
```
> [[🏠base|🏠]] · [📅 Today](obsidian://daily) · [[Workout Program|🏋️ Program]]
```

**Critical:**
- ✅ **ONLY ONE** navigation header per note
- ✅ **Always** use `[📅 Today](obsidian://daily)` for Today link (dynamic)
- ✅ **Area notes link to their area hub** (one click back to context)
- ✅ Yesterday/Tomorrow in daily notes use static date wikilinks
- ❌ Never use static dates for Today link

---

### 3. Note Structure
```
---
frontmatter
---
[blank line]
> navigation header
[blank line]
---
[blank line]
# Note Title

```

## 🚨 Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. ❌ Creating notes without frontmatter
2. ❌ Leaving `area:` empty or blank
3. ❌ Multiple navigation headers in one note
4. ❌ Using static dates for Today link: `[[2026-03-02|Today]]`
5. ❌ Creating subfolders in `Notes/` (except Fitness/Logs)
6. ❌ Forgetting tags in frontmatter
7. ❌ Navigation header not first line after frontmatter
